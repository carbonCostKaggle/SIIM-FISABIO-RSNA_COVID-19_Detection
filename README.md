# SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA_COVID-19_Detection

A solution for the Kaggle Competition [SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19 Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/siim-covid19-detection/): Identify and localize COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs. 

The purpose of this repo is to re-create the process for a kaggle competition and document the carbon footprint of one entry using the tool [CarbonTracker](https://github.com/lfwa/carbontracker). 

Data can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/siim-covid19-detection/data). Once unzipped, the data should be copied into the folder structure provided, with all of the training data folders placed in the [train](https://github.com/carbonCostKaggle/SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA_COVID-19_Detection/tree/main/data/train) folder, and likewise with the test data.
